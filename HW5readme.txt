Kevin gave me the idea to make edge and state classes, and it helped a lot. I mostly knew how to do everything
myself in this assignment, I only had to look up a few things about classes and used your example
code for formatting (the triple quotation thing helped a lot)

I think that everything mostly works, except My states and events are in a different order than yours

I know there aren't many comments, but I thought most of it was readable.



Classes:

This is what I used for defaults, although I ended up changing it
